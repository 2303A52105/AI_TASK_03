🖼🧠 Image Captioning AI This project combines Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to generate human-like captions for images. It uses pre-trained CNNs (like ResNet or VGG) for image feature extraction and an RNN or Transformer-based model to generate descriptive captions.

📌 Features Extracts high-level features from images using pre-trained CNNs

Generates captions using an RNN (LSTM/GRU) or Transformer model

Trained on datasets like MS COCO (or a smaller custom dataset)

Clean and modular codebase

Easily extendable for fine-tuning and experimentation

🧰 Tech Stack Python 3

PyTorch / TensorFlow (choose one)

NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib

Pre-trained CNNs: ResNet50 / VGG16

RNN / Transformer for caption generation

Jupyter Notebook for development & visualization

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the Repository bash Copy Edit git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning-ai.git cd image-captioning-ai
Install Dependencies Using pip:
bash Copy Edit pip install -r requirements.txt Make sure you have PyTorch or TensorFlow installed depending on your implementation.

Prepare Dataset Download and preprocess image-caption dataset (like MS COCO).
You can also test on custom images by placing them in the images/ folder.

css Copy Edit Generated Caption: "A brown dog is running through a grassy field." 📊 Evaluation BLEU, METEOR, and CIDEr scores for caption quality

Qualitative analysis via visualization

📈 Future Enhancements Add attention mechanism to focus on image regions

Use transformers like ViT + BERT/GPT for end-to-end generation

Deploy with a Flask web app or Streamlit interface
